# code-refactor-horiseon

## Description 

This is a refactor of the [Horiseon](https://stuart540.github.io/code-refactor-horiseon/) website to improve accessability and search engine optimisation. The refactor started by substituting the divs to appropriate semantic html tags then updating the [style.css](assets/css/style.css) to maintain the function. The style.css was then edited to reduce complexity and improve readability.

Through the refactoring process I have improved my knowledge of semantic html to hopefully make me a better developer.
